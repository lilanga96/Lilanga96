### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile, I am a software development student at codeSpace academy,  I fell inlove with coding when I enrolled on a web design course in 2022, since then I have been trying on new challenges and looking for ways to enhance my skills in the software development world

I am an introverted person, I find solace in sunsets,sunrise,rain and the ocean.

below are some of the projects that I worked on:
 1.Kitchen-app https://github.com/lilanga96/Kitchen-app 
 2.Book-app https://github.com/lilanga96/Book-connect
